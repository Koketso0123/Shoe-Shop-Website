    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how San Antonio Winery, 
    doing business as “Sweet Wine Club,” uses the information you provide
    to us that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) as well
  as general, non-personal information that is automatically collected
   from our site (“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy
    applies only to the Personal Information and Non-Personal
     Information we collect through our website.  

    </p>
    <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
         If you do not agree to our practices, please do not register,
          subscribe, create an account, or otherwise interact with Sweet Wine Club atthe Website. 
        By visiting the Website, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h1>Information Collection</h1>

        <p>Sweet Wine Club collects Personal Information to customize the content and/or
             layout of the Website for each member and to contact members regarding their accounts. 
             If a member chooses to place an order through the Website, we or our service
          provider may collect additional information including, but not limited to, 
          the member’s billing address, shipping address, date of birth, date of order,
            and product ordered (“Transaction Information”).</p>

       <p>Sweet Wine Club may also collect Non-Personal Information or general 
        statistics about each user that visits the Sweet Wine Club Website. 
        Non-Personal Information is collected and recorded to understand statistics
         and usage of the Sweet Wine Club Website. Non-Personal Information includes,
      but is not limited to, a user’s ISP (Internet Service Provider),
       IP (Internet Protocol) address, the type of web browser used, which pages
        a user visits, and other site usage data. This information is completely
         anonymous and used to analyze Sweet Wine Club’s Website traffic and
      other statistics relating to the usage of its Website.

            </p>

            <h1>Use and Disclosure of Information, and Opt-Out Procedure</h1>

            <p>Sweet Wine Club may disclose Personal Information if it is required to
             do so by law or if disclosing Personal Information is vital to identify, 
             contact, or bring legal action in order to protect Sweet Wine Club,
              its customers, or third parties. In addition, Personal Information
             that you provide to us (such as your name, address and email address) 
           may be combined with other personally identifiable information 
            (such as demographic information and past Transaction Information) 
             available from our records and other sources. This information will
           be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient.
             This information may also be shared with our third party service 
             providers that assist us with our sales processing and marketing 
          efforts and with other marketers whose products or services we feel
          may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your
           personally identifiable information with other marketers, please
            email us at support@sweetwineclub.com. If you choose to opt out,
             please note that the following three paragraphs will still apply:</p>

             <p>Transaction Information will be shared with our credit card
               processor and any third party from whom the purchase is made, 
               and may be provided to other trusted third parties as necessary
                to process and fulfill the order, and to help enable Sweet Wine
               Club to provide better member services and offerings.
               All such merchants and third parties are contractually obligated
                to keep all Transaction Information confidential, maintain
               the privacy of all Sweet Wine Club members, and to use such
                Transaction Information only to provide services to Sweet
                 Wine Club for the benefit of Sweet Wine Club and its members.
                  Transaction Information may also be used to develop a personalized
                 profile and shopping history for each member in order to customize 
                 promotions, updates or special offers.</p>

                 <p>From time to time, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform services,
                   to maintain and operate the Website, and to maintain certain features on the Website.
                    To such parties, we may disclose Non-Personal Information such as traffic patterns 
                    and Website usage data, but such information will not include Personal Information.
                     We also may employ reputable third parties to analyze our sales data for internal 
                     analysis, during which we may disclose Personal Information 
                  such as the wines purchased, the location of shipment, and the frequency of purchases.</p>

                  <p>We additionally may enlist a third party to assist with marketing and sending 
                    member e-mails; in this case, we will provide these third party vendors 
                only with member e-mail addresses. These third parties will not receive
                 or be given access to other Personal Information
                 (such as Sweet Wine Club member home addresses, phone numbers, or date of birth)
                 unless Sweet Wine Club is required to do so by law or unless disclosing
                 such Personal Information is vital to identify, contact, or bring legal 
                 action in order to protect Sweet Wine Club, its customers, or third parties.

                  place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. A cookie
                is a small amount of information that a web server sends 
                to your browser that stores information about your account,
                 preferences and use of the Website. Cookies allow us to 
                 recognize you when you return and track and target your 
                 interests in order to provide a customized experien
                 They also help us to detect certain kinds of fraud.
                 We use cookies to store a member’s preferences, 
                record session information, record member-specific information 
                on what pages are accessed or visited, alert members to new
                areas that we think might be of interest to them when 
                they return to our Website, or customize web page content
                 based on browser type or other information that the member sends.</p>

                 <p>“Session” cookies are temporary cookies used for various 
                reasons, such as managing page views and your shopping cart.
               Typically, your browser will erase session cookies once you 
              exit the browser. “Persistent” cookies are more permanent cookies
             that are stored on your computer or mobile device after you exit 
            the browser. Persistent cookies allow us to retrieve certain information 
          that you have previously provided to us (for example, your user ID if you 
        ask to be remembered). The Sweet Wine Club Website may use both session and persistent cookies.

                </p>

                <p>We may also use web beacons. Web beacons are tiny graphic images
                   placed on website pages or in our e-mails that allow us to
                   determine whether you have performed certain actions.
                   When you access these pages or open e-mail messages, 
                   the web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, 
                  or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure 
                response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>

                <p>You may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies

                adopt the program, we will provide you a unique referral link 
              that you can share directly with others via message from Sweet Wine Club,
